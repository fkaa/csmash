How to compile csmash on NT

You need two external libraries.
  zlib-1.1.3, glut-3.7
You can get these libraries from <URL:http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/zlib/>,
<URL:http://reality.sgi.com/mjk/glut3/glut3.html>, respectively.

Dig a directory named "GL" here, and place glut library headers under the
directory. Put other files at source directory.

There may be a separate binary distribution named 
"csmashlibs-i386-win32.tar.gz". It contains the libraries you need.
