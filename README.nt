How to compile csmash on WindowsNT.

Note: I have no idea if it can be compiled on windows9x.

You need some external libraries.
  zlib-1.1.3, SDL-1.1.3, gtk-1.2
You can get these libraries from
  <URL:http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/zlib/>,
  <URL:http://www.libsdl.org/>,
  <URL:http://www.gimp.org/~tml/gimp/win32/new-downloads.html>,
 respectively.
It is better you get SDL_mixer, SDL_image from libsdl.org too.

Use of gnu-make is strongly recommended. 
You can build csmash with nmake.exe (I believe), but I do not tested it well.
You may need some sh.exe or bash.exe too, when you are using gnu-make.

If you have gnu-make, run "gmake -f Makefile.w32".
Object files are created in objs.win32 subdirectory.
If you are using nmake.exe, run "nmake -f Makefile.nt"
Object files are created in this directory.

There may be a separate binary distribution named 
"csmashlibs-i386-win32.tar.gz". It contains the libraries you need.
